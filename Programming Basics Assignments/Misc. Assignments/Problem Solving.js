//How do I hold all the numbers together? I can use an array. 
//Ooh! I can use index numbers to help with this. 

//Take the number at an index point and compare it to the other spots 
//in the index to see if it's higher or lower. Once it finds a spot in the index where it's greater 
//to the one of the left and less than the one on the right, it stops.

//Pretty sure in order to do this I'm gonna need arrays, loops, and conditions. 
//Let's take it one thing at a time. Array first...



//IDENTIFY a strategy: I guess I could try it by comparing each number to each other one and 
//have it stop when it reaches a spot when they are less than the number to the right but more 
//than the number to the right.Like, is 1 higher than 5(no, so it goes to the left of the 5), 
//then is 5 higher than 1(yes), is 5 higher than 341, 
//(no, so it goes to the left of 341 but right of the 1).
//341 higher than 1(yes), is it higher than 5(yes), is it higher than 2(yes), 
//is it higher than 46(yes, so it goes to the right of 46).Is 2 higher than 1(yes), 
//higher than 5(no, so it stops just before 5), etc. 


//The hardest part of problem solving is thinking about the actual problem to understand the problem 
//before actually solving the problem. We need to Think and talk about the problem with ourselves
//and once that's done then we should go into identifying which strategy to use. We should always be 
//thinking about different ways we can solve a problem, but once all that is done then we can solve 
//a problem with confidence and put our strategy to the test.
